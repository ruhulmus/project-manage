## Disaster Recovery & Alternate Plans

### Plan B: Timeline Extension Scenarios

If the project encounters unforeseen challenges that threaten the timeline, we have the following contingency plans:

#### Scenario 1: Minor Delays (1-2 Sprints Behind)
- **Trigger**: Sprint velocity is consistently below plan for 2-3 sprints
- **Action Plan**:
  - Activate first month of contingency buffer
  - Reprioritize backlog to focus on critical features
  - Consider adding resources to critical path tasks
  - Implement overtime for key team members (with compensation)
  - Review and optimize development processes

#### Scenario 2: Significant Delays (3-4 Sprints Behind)
- **Trigger**: Multiple sprint goals not achieved, critical path affected
- **Action Plan**:
  - Activate full contingency buffer
  - Implement feature prioritization with client
  - Define MVP vs. post-launch features
  - Temporarily increase team size in bottleneck areas
  - Consider phased deployment approach

#### Scenario 3: Critical Failure or Disaster
- **Trigger**: Major technical failure, key staff departure, or external disaster
- **Action Plan**:
  - Immediately notify client and convene emergency steering committee
  - Activate full contingency buffer plus extended timeline discussion
  - Implement modular delivery approach focusing on the application reception module first
  - Consider bringing in specialized external resources for critical components
  - Evaluate technical alternatives that could accelerate implementation
  - Implement temporary solutions to maintain business continuity
  - Develop parallel workstreams with dedicated teams

### Technical Disaster Recovery Plans

#### CMS Implementation Failure
- **Trigger**: Business users unable to effectively use CMS despite multiple iterations
- **Alternative Solution**:
  - Implement simplified CMS with reduced feature set
  - Provide dedicated content management support team
  - Add "content entry as a service" option where our team handles complex content
  - Consider third-party CMS integration if custom development is the blocker

#### Enterprise Integration Failure
- **Trigger**: Unable to reliably integrate with enterprise systems
- **Alternative Solution**:
  - Implement asynchronous data exchange with manual reconciliation
  - Develop alternative API integration patterns
  - Create standalone module with scheduled data synchronization
  - Provide temporary data entry interface for manual updates

#### Infrastructure Performance Issues
- **Trigger**: AWS infrastructure not meeting performance requirements
- **Alternative Solution**:
  - Rapidly evaluate alternative cloud providers for specific components
  - Implement multi-cloud strategy for performance-critical components
  - Redesign architecture to use more managed services
  - Consider hybrid approach with dedicated hardware for critical components

#### Team Capacity Disaster
- **Trigger**: Multiple key team members unavailable simultaneously
- **Alternative Solution**:
  - Activate backup resource pool from our company's other projects
  - Engage specialized contractor team for targeted components
  - Implement simplified architecture for faster delivery
  - Reprioritize features with customer to focus on business-critical elements

### Jira & Agile Process Disaster Recovery

#### Sprint Failure Recovery Process
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Hold emergency sprint retrospective
   - Analyze root causes of sprint failure
   - Adjust velocity expectations
   
2. **Process Adjustments**:
   - Break down stories into smaller, more manageable tasks
   - Add additional QA resources for early testing
   - Implement pair programming for complex components
   - Increase technical oversight on critical path items
   
3. **Reporting & Communication**:
   - Daily status updates to stakeholders
   - Transparent reporting on recovery progress
   - Weekly steering committee review of adjusted plan

### Project Delivery Guarantees

Despite potential challenges, we ensure the following no matter what:

1. **Business Continuity**: Application reception will be prioritized to prevent the $500/hour revenue loss
2. **Core Functionality**: MVP functionality will be delivered within the contracted timeline
3. **Quality Standard**: No more than 3 bugs in reception functionality guaranteed
4. **Documentation**: Complete documentation regardless of implementation challenges
5. **Budget Compliance**: No budget overruns—we will reprioritize scope rather than exceed budget

## Jira Workflow & Agile Project Management

### Agile Metrics Tracking

We will track the following metrics to ensure project health:

1. **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
2. **Sprint Burndown**: Daily progress toward sprint goal
3. **Release Burnup**: Progress toward release completion
4. **Cycle Time**: Average time to complete a story
