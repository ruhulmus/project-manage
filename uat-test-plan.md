## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan outlines the approach, resources, and schedule to be used for validating that the Web System Replacement meets business requirements and is fit for purpose. This document will guide all UAT activities and serve as the basis for evaluation of system readiness for production deployment.

### 1.2 Background

The Web System Replacement Project aims to replace the existing legacy web system with a modern, scalable solution that addresses current business needs and technical requirements. The system has been designed and developed according to the approved requirements and is now ready for user acceptance testing prior to production deployment.

## 2. UAT Objectives

The primary objectives of User Acceptance Testing for the Web System Replacement are:

1. **Validate Business Requirements**: Ensure the system satisfies all documented business requirements and meets user expectations.

2. **Verify Process Workflows**: Confirm that business process workflows function correctly and efficiently.

3. **Validate Data Integrity**: Ensure data is processed accurately and maintains integrity throughout the system.

4. **Assess Usability**: Evaluate the user experience and ensure the interface is intuitive and effective.

5. **Verify Integration**: Confirm that the system properly integrates with all required external systems.

6. **Validate Security Implementation**: Ensure the system implements required security controls and protects sensitive data.

7. **Assess Performance**: Verify the system meets performance requirements under expected user loads.

8. **Confirm Operational Readiness**: Ensure support procedures, documentation, and training materials are sufficient.

9. **Obtain Formal Acceptance**: Secure sign-off from business stakeholders confirming the system is ready for production deployment.

## 3. Test Strategy

### 3.1 Testing Approach

The UAT will follow a risk-based approach, focusing on high-priority business functions and critical user journeys. Testing will be conducted by actual business users following predefined test scripts, supplemented by exploratory testing to uncover edge cases and usability issues.

- **Phased Testing**: Testing will be conducted in a phased approach:
  - Phase 1: Core functionality and critical user journeys
  - Phase 2: Secondary functionality and integration scenarios
  - Phase 3: End-to-end business process validation

- **Test Types**:
  - Scripted tests based on documented business requirements
  - Exploratory tests to uncover issues not captured in formal test cases
  - End-to-end business process testing
  - Integration testing with external systems
  - Security validation testing
  - Performance validation (for critical functions)

### 3.2 Testing Methods

| Test Method | Description | When Used |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Scripted Testing | Following predefined step-by-step test scripts | Primary testing of all functionality |
| Exploratory Testing | Free-form testing based on user knowledge | After completing scripted tests |
| Scenario-based Testing | Tests that follow complete business processes | For validating end-to-end workflows |
| Integration Testing | Tests that verify system interfaces | For validating external system connections |
| User Experience Testing | Focus on usability and UI aspects | Throughout all UAT phases |

### 3.3 Test Metrics

The following metrics will be collected and reported during UAT:

- Test completion rate (% of planned tests executed)
- Test pass rate (% of executed tests passed)
- Defect metrics (count by priority and status)
- Requirements coverage (% of requirements validated)
- Critical path verification (% of critical user journeys verified)
